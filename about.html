        <p class="about-text">
            I am an artist, designer, and developer from Seoul, South Korea, currently based in Seoul and New York City. I am a recent MFA graduate from the Department of Visual Arts (DoVA) at the University of Chicago. In college, I received training in computer science and linguistics in addition to my major in Studio Art at Grinnell College. This website contains involvements that are mostly related to programming and design.<br><br>
            My design practice explores systems and languages as frameworks for creating adaptable experiences. I focus on producing versatile interactions that allow people to engage with concepts from multiple perspectives. Whether through interface design, spatial layouts, or interactive environments, my work emphasizes modularity, clarity, and accessibility. By integrating digital and physical elements, I aim to craft experiences that are dynamic, layered, and open to interpretation.
            <br><br>More information regarding my art practice can be found  <a href="https://simonkim.nyc" target="_blank">here</a>.
