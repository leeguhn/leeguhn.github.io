    <b>Narcissus</b> is an interactive simulation in which personal choices manifest as architectural structures in real time. Players build their environments by passing through doors and mirrors, shaping their world through room alignments, rotations, and scale shifts. Each decision determines the evolving blueprint of their space.
  </p>

  <p><b>Core Mechanics</b></p>
  <p>I. <i>Rooms & Doors</i>: Each room has three doors—one expands the building, one loops back, and one transforms into a mirror</p>
  <p>II. <i>Mirror Rooms</i>: Entering a mirror shifts dimensions, triggering changes in scale, rotation, or directional flow of ladders  </p>
  <p>III. <i>Dimensional Shifts</i>: Nearly every action alters the simulation’s mechanics for a dynamic, evolving experience.  </p><br>

  <p><b>Conceptual Foundations</b></p>
  <p>Narcissus draws from quantum mechanics, psychology, and mythology to explore perception, identity, and transformation. Inspired by quantum superposition, mirrors act as gateways to alternate possibilities, where choices collapse potential realities into defined outcomes. The mirror room’s mechanics reflect quantum entanglement—decisions ripple outward, shaping the entire environment.</p>
  <p>Rooted in the myth of Narcissus, the simulation examines self-reflection and transformation. Stepping into a mirror alters the game world, mirroring the psychological process of introspection: understanding oneself to enact change. Narcissus is an experiential metaphor for the fluid relationship between the self and its surroundings.</p>
  <p><b>Connections to Design</b></p>
  <p>Narcissus explores design as an evolving dialogue between form, function, and interaction. By presenting ambiguous affordances such as doors that transform into mirrors, rooms that shift in scale and orientation, the simulation mirrors principles of interaction design, spatial design, and speculative architecture. Players intuitively construct and navigate spaces, revealing how perception shapes behavior and decision-making. Like experimental objects that challenge predefined uses, Narcissus invites users to interpret, adapt, and co-create their environments, offering insights into how design can provoke novel responses and reconfigure experience.</p>
