    <i>Hansel</i> is a program developed to explore new ways of working with visual elements. It is about breaking things down and rearranging visual components to experience an image differently. Elements like lines and edges are more than just basic structures; they shape how we perceive and organize visual information.
    It operates in two distinct stages:</p>
    </p>
  <p>
    <b>Asset Extraction</b>: The program analyzes a source image and breaks it down into individual visual elements, like lines, shapes, or textures. These elements are then turned into reusable assets.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Composition Generation</b>: The second step takes a new input image as a guide and arranges the extracted assets to follow the shapes and contours of that image, creating a new composition.

    <p><center>Here is a sample use case. Let's say an artist wants to generate images with their painting.</center></p>
        <div class="image-row"> <img alt="painting" src="hansel-images/painting.jpeg"> </div>
    <p><center>They produce a photo or scan that shows the visual content of the work.</center></p>
        <div class="image-row"> <img alt="scan" src="hansel-images/scan.jpeg"> </div>
    <p><center>Hansel identifies the individual elements and separates them as assets in a folder.</center></p>
        <div class="image-row"> <img alt="folder" src="hansel-images/folder.png"> </div>
    <p><center>The user provides Hansel another image to re-map the assets based on its shape.</center></p>
        <div class="image-row"> <img alt="contour" src="hansel-images/govind.jpg"> </div>
    <p><center>Multiple iterations turn the work into a moving picture.</center></p>
        <div class="image-row"> <img alt="gif" src="hansel-images/gov.gif"></div>
    <p> The program's graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to modify the parameters themselves to open more room for creative outcomes, such as the potential to generate sequences of images that could be used for animation or stop-motion-like effects. Currently, the code offers options to 1) find images online from Flickr's API, 2) specify the number of iterations to produce, 3) and alter the density and/or size of the assets.</p>
