        <p><strong>Lucia Neirotti</strong> is a PhD student with the Art History department specialising in South American art. Her research interests include performance and its archives, extra-institutional collectives, and conceptualist strategies developed during dictatorship.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Kyrin Hobson</strong> is a Chicago based interdisciplinary artist, educator and museum professional.
        Her paintings and installations investigate the visual language of philosophical, juridic, and social constructions of race in the Americas. Interest areas intersect around reproduction, history and health equity. Through the lens of motherhood, the work centers body movement, kinship, hybridity, ecologies of care, and the ways in which women aggregate, transfer and utilize power.
        Hobson is currently a Visual Art Teaching Fellow at the University of Chicago and Feminist in Residence at the Northwestern University Women’s Center.</p>

        <p>Before the beginning of our talk, Kyrin and I install two of her most recent paintings; although her practice has spanned multi-media installation, sculpture, digital art and charcoal drawing, it is these two figurative works that have been the focus of our conversations. Carried in heavy rolls, we unfurled them now on the ground then hoisted them up from the bar spanning their top edges with two pronged staves, less ‘hung’ than hoisted like flags. Leaning upright against the walls, the passage from studio to exhibition was performed here in miniature, concluding in a situation explicitly temporary. They had just been put down; they could be picked up again at any time. </p>
        
        <p><em>I want the painting to have a life… I refute the idea of stretching a painting painfully taut and hanging it in a state of stasis. The immediacy of that potential of motion carries something valuable for me that is culturally translatable… I want the pieces to be touched.</em></p>
        
        <p>Such is the nature of Kyrin Hobson’s engagement and departure from the canons of Western art history; it is one sample among many and she shows it no loyalty. Kyrin works with oil paint on canvas but her support is unstretched. Nude figures move with anatomical precision and gestural concision within landscapes abstracted into luminous fields of colour that map receding space in fields. But there is no perspectival oneness to them. In Surreal dreamscapes, time is charted as movement, spatially. The same woman repeats once and again, layered on herself in successive motions. Almost life-size and flush against the ground, mimicking the scale and space of real bodies, to stand in front of her (them?) is to feel a pull into and through. Facing the picture-screen, over five feet tall, transforms passive viewership into active confrontation by the movement depicted. Carrying the works, as their fragile hang invites and allows, is to activate the picture-object by the movement performed. </p>

        <p><em>When we talk about negotiating difference, holding space face-to-face, body-to-body with a painting is an offering to transcend the distances we put between ourselves.</em> </p>
        
        <p>With this gesture, Kyrin finds herself amongst a wide array of practices, traditions and rituals. A long-time student and custodian of non-Western art, she cites Haitian drapeux, the AIC’s bronze Shiva Nataraja and the processions she grew up with in Louisiana easily and unpretentiously in conversation, with a soft-spoken mastery. Regardless of medium, Kyrin imagines her works as having the temporality of an event, living sites of encounter that take place visually, haptically, by sound and by smell. Rejecting the taxidermied state of finished paintings on museum walls, her practice is oriented towards process, subject to continuous revision and resisting closure. Kyrin’s hybrids function like metaphors for memory, a whirlpool of fragments that only congeal in concrete form in the instance of encounter. </p>
        
        <p><em>I can receive an idea even if it’s partial and take it and manifest it to be… an archive of the forgotten.</em> </p>
        
        <p>These ahistorical scenes look for universals in the human experience in the motion of the body; <em>‘hunting, feeding, cultivating and caregiving’,</em> Kyrin depicts figures engaged in <em>‘movements of survival.’</em> But there is also a specificity directed to present struggles and in this she is unambiguous and direct: Kyrin puts Black female bodies at the centre of her work. Self-authorised, in motion and foregrounded as the model for an an expansive and multi-dimensional humanity, Kyrin paints to defy centuries of marginalisation. Her protagonists project the role she images for the artist: an active agent of change. </p>

        <p><em>Art, for me, has to do something… As a Black woman my tradition is these very pragmatic purposes of survivability, so of course my art is going to flow into that tradition as upholding archive, giving visual form to practices that might have been lost.</em></p>
        
        <p>Inextricable from this project is Kyrin’s engagement with the traditions of Louisiana midwives and the politics of birthing in America. As much an interviewer and archivist as a visual artist, her works give new forms to untold histories inherited from a matrilineal throughline. The wisdom of her elders is celebrated, embodied in the form of her models, Kyrin’s own daughters, who, as they double and triple over themselves on the canvas, articulate a generational compounding of identity. These images of agentive, powerful women are triumphal. But, in carving out this space from a context of terrible loss, they address a social and political imperative. In the United States, the racial disparity in maternal health is so severe that Black birthing people are three times more likely to die giving birth. Kyrin creates environments rather than mere images, generating movement and speaking to the senses and, in doing so, the impossible magnitude of systemic oppression is returned to the scale of the body; data is made visceral. These two landscapes, free-floating on warped canvas, enshrine the grace of healers and keeps their power alive. </p>
        
        <p><em>We see data encapsulated in hard, bare infographics… it must be served with something that is more human… Visceralising data simply means taking it to the heart, to the core of the body… to tell a tale of survival that could be really lost to time.</em></p>
