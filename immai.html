  <p>IMMAI is a mobile game currently in development to make language learning immersive and engaging through AI/ML technologies. The team consists of 6 front & backend engineers and me as the artist and designer, contributing to the project when available. We are integrating interactive gameplay with adaptive learning mechanics to create a personalized experience for users.
    </p>    
  
  <p>As the Art & UI+UX Designer, my contributions include:
    </p> 
    
    <p>
        <b>UI/UX Design:</b> Crafting intuitive interfaces to ensure seamless navigation and accessibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Art Direction:</b> Developing the visual style, including character designs, icons, and environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Collaboration with Programmers:</b> Aligning UI/UX elements with AI-driven language-learning features to create a cohesive experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Asset Generation Strategy:</b> Conceptualizing a system to dynamically generate assets as the game's scope expands.
    </p>
    
  <p>I prioritize accessibility, engagement, and adaptability in my design process, ensuring that IMMAI remains both visually compelling and functionally effective for learners at various proficiency levels.</p>
