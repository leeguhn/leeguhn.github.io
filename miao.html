  <p><b>Claire Carcara</b> (she/her) is currently a Provost Fellow and PhD student in the Department of Art History at the University of Southern California. Her research focuses on the intersection of alternative exhibition spaces and exhibition history, histories of collecting, institutional critique, and (non-traditional) materiality. She has previously held curatorial and research internships at the David & Alfred Smart Museum of Art (University of Chicago), where she worked on the exhibitions Monochrome Multitudes (2022) and Calling on the Past (2023). Prior to attending USC, Claire received her M.A. in the Humanities from the University of Chicago (2023).</p>
  <p><b>Miao Wang</b> is an artist and currently a second-year graduate student in the Department of Visual Arts at The University of Chicago. She received her BA in Art History from The University of Illinois at Chicago in 2016. Wang's studio practice embraces unpredictability while working to deconstruct color. Pigment and water collect and separate in real time, ultimately drying in a suspended state to mirror the evolution of her identity.</p>

  <center><p><i>Miao Wang: On Morphology, Evolution, and "Aesthetic Ecology"</i> by Claire Carcara</p></center>
  <p>At their most simplified or reduced, Miao Wang's works can be described as an articulation of two key compositional components: color and surface, or perhaps more accurately, color on surface. Her body of work is dominated by watercolor paintings on synthetic YUPO paper, lending them a delicate translucency; this paper allows viewers to examine Wang's involved layering process, the formal vestiges of water moving across the paper's surface, and the purposeful imperfections that the artist often generates through handling the still-wet paper. Through extensive layering of multiple colors, Wang has generated incredibly complex surfaces, which speak to the nature of pure form. In choosing which colors to include in a given work, Wang's mode of making is quite diplomatic-the artist embraces the opportunity for chance and accident. Her method emerges as on the one hand, repetitive and mechanical and, on the other hand, equally experimental and organic. Her method is made visible through the works' fragile forms, which can at times allude to geological formations or fade into swathes of pure monochromes. Wang's embrace of organicity is thus indicative of both the artist's mode of working as well as the "lifecycle" of the artworks themselves.</p>

  <p>In thinking about the lifecycle of an artwork, what is an "aesthetic ecology"? The term was coined by reductive artist Russell Maltz (b. 1952) to describe the way in which materials have both a cyclical trajectory in their usage as well as an affordance for transformation. At once invoking the natural and the organic, the term also implies a material-driven eco-system as well as connotations of recycling or re-use. Beyond art practice, art historical discourse also once leant heavily on terminology from the natural scientists. Through considering the evolutionary cycling of forms, art historians adopted an aesthetic variant of the scientific method and put forth the idea that historians could borrow both methodology and terminology from the naturalists in order to chart morphology-the shifting, changing nature of form-through time, describing periods of artistic production in terms of art's flowering: both bloom and decay. Later art historians built on the conflation of formal development with evolutionary science, articulating that art history, and aesthetic forms, could be articulated as an organic, growing entity.</p>
  <p>Appearing throughout early art historiography, this thread of formalistic thought informs much of this essay, as a continuation of the formalist-meets-naturalist approach echoes the ways in which Wang's work floats indiscriminately between formal aesthetics and naturalism. Just as scientists study the evolution of a species, art may be reduced to a cyclical, chronological thread of blooming, followed by decay, only to once again repeat the cycle; art-by its very nature-always leaves room for growth. Despite often being viewed as static, artistic forms regularly evolve, allowing critics and artists alike to study art's historical morphology.</p>

  <p>In addition to developing a formalist methodology, art historian Heinrich Wöfflin (1864 - 1945) also coined the idea of "visual strata."<a href="#ftnt1">[1]</a>  He suggests excavating these strata-and thereby revealing the history of vision-must be regarded as the primary task of art history. Notably, "strata'' has strong geological leanings, often referring to layers of sediment, or perhaps more generally, layers of material. Wang undeniably deals in "visual strata'' both literally, through her experimentation with layering, and conceptually, through her work's playful challenging of extant categories (such as her preference for calling her practice painting despite its commercial status as a drawing, due to the usage of paper as support). As Wölfflin intended, the idea of visual strata is transtemporal and stretches transmedially, echoing the history of vision. As such, Wang's body of work-and its allusions to both the medium of watercolor and the developmental process of photography-can be situated within larger histories. Much like the photographers who favor working in analog, Wang "develops" her paintings in a manner akin to submerging photo paper in chemical developer. At once referencing the realities of generating photographs as well as some of photography's historic subject matter (the landscape), Wang's works, over time, similarly reveal their latent form to the artist as she works; her mode of working encompasses all stages of making, including seeing, creating, re-making, re-visiting, and even un-making. Apart from photography, Wang also notes her work's departure from the various historical connotations of watercolor, which often include studies, botanical observations, and preparatory work for larger works in more "permanent" media, such as-for example-oil paint.</p>

      <p>Although she uses watercolor to generate abstract, monochromatic surfaces, Wang remains interested in these historical uses of water-based media and has adopted much of the "scientific" components of these early images in her own exploration of color. Using both found color-in the form of salvaged Old Holland tubes of watercolor, where either the pigment has nearly completely dried or separated entirely from the binder-as well as the predictably titled store-bought tubes, Wang keeps a record of each color in her collection, charting its appearance on YUPO paper and building a repository of color samples. Color, of course, is one of Wang's key interests, operating as the connecting force between her work and historical precedents. Even amongst the differing forms of contemporary and historical watercolor, the medium continues to share an interest in mimicking nature through color. Of interest to Wang is the idea that within these historical examples, the color-and the pigment that generates it-loses an element of its identity when being used in any other context than as pure color. As part of her exploration of color's ontology, Wang thus poses the key question: what does color do on its own?</p>

      <p>And yet, the color which Wang generates is often unidentifiable-a new species of color; the artist has even commented upon the way in which her final layer creates the appearance of "unnamable" colors. In addition to the biological connotations of the living color within the artists' works, the notion of ecology-and its botanical, bodily connections to various life forms-also applies to the paper Wang uses; the artist notes the way in which YUPO is akin to an organism. YUPO's appeal for Wang resides in both its foggy, translucent color (although the paper is also available in a more opaque white) as well as the paper's ability to absorb some-but not all-the pigment that is applied to its surface. Wang has compared the synthetic surface of YUPO to skin, noting the way the paper, like skin, can simultaneously absorb water while allowing some to run off, which leaves space for experimentation and risk in the artist's practice. Beyond the artist's likening of the paper to skin, the body-predominantly the body of the artist herself-is implicated in the making of these works. When handling the still-wet pieces, fingerprints are generated, almost always along the edge. However, upon the works' exhibition-which has recently taken the form of an artist's book that Wang encourages visitors to leaf through and handle-pigment is often transferred to the visitor's skin. Interaction with the piece is thus marked by a double impression: the visitor's fingerprint remains as part of the unfixed works at the same time the lost pigment temporarily operates as a stain on the skin.</p>

      <p>As Wang's book continues to be shown, it will continue to change, morphing from pristine pages to images which tell the story of their handling. Concerned with creation via combination, Wang's process borders on the alchemical, rather than remaining purely artistic in its exploration. This notion of alchemy lends an air of uncertainty or even an exploited fragility, as Wang often re-visits paintings created even years earlier. Once re-activated in water, the old surface can become new. Whether Wang decides to add more pigment, or with a brush, to remove some of the existing color, the work (in the hands of the artist) remains in a state of flux; devoid of fixative or other means of preservation, Wang perpetually invites the cycle of change. She remains open to evolution.</p>

      <p><a href="#ftnt_ref1">[1]</a> Wölfflin's statement is one of the best-known passages in art historiography: "Vision itself has its history, and the revelation of these visual strata must be regarded as the primary task of art history." The history of vision was also notably taken up by Alois Riegl, an art historian working at the turn of the century, in his work Late Roman Art Industry (originally published in 1901), where he argued that ancient peoples perceived the world in radically different ways than their modern counterparts. Wölfflin's statement appears in Heinrich Wölfflin, Principles of Art History: The Problem of the Development of Style in Later Art, 7th edition [1932], trans. M.D. Hottinger (New York: Dover, 1950), 11. For more on Riegl's concept of visual history, see Alois Riegl, Late Roman Art Industry, trans. Rolf Winkes (Rome: Giorgio Bretschneider, 1985), 232.</p>
