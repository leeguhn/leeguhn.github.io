  <p><strong>Iona (Bohan) Liu</strong> (she/her) graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and holds her MFA degree at the University of Chicago. As an independent artist, she seeks to redefine the concepts of fertility and reproduction across various mediums, freeing modern women's reproductive choices from traditional norms and re-evaluating women's life choices as independent entities. She is currently exploring the use of reproductive symbols and visual language from archaeology and burial culture to comment on the power and position of women in present-day society.</p>

  <p><center><i>Cyborgization</i></center></p>
  <p><center>"I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess."</center></p>
  <p><center>- Donna Haraway, <i>A Cyborg Manifesto</i>, 1985</center></p>
  <p>Donna Haraway is a cultural theorist, feminist, and scholar known for her groundbreaking work in the intersection of technology, socialism and feminism. In one of her most influential works, A Cyborg Manifesto, she utilizes the amalgamation of cybernetic and organism in the cyborg as a prelude to conceptualize a framework where boundaries between nature and machine, human and animal, become blurred. It presents a post-structuralist vision that moves towards a more fluid and inclusive understanding of identity. Haraway believes that framing the cyborg as a female entity is an act of resistance. Once relegated to being military tools, objects of pornography, and figures from predominantly male-defined science fiction, the reimagining of cyborgs challenges these traditional roles. If I were to pinpoint a central term for Iona's There Is A Woman on the Pedestal, "cyborgization" would be my choice.In alignment with Haraway's concept, she challenges essentialist ideology, which asserts that birth bestows inherent and unalterable qualities defining individuals. The audience witnessed a collaborative birthing scene executed by both human and machine.</p>
  <p>People in my age group, growing up in mainland China, often share the experience of being captivated by the non-stop dramas broadcast on the radiant screen during scorching summer days. Most of these were adaptations of classical literature, featuring subpar special effects and hazy visuals. Although currently labeled as "kitschy," Iona draws inspiration from these cultural and childhood recollections, revitalizing them through her techno-artistic creations. Her latest performance, There Is A Woman on the Pedestal, represents a feminist revival of the trope-beauty metamorphosing into a skeleton-found in both Journey to the West (fig.1) and Red Chamber (fig.2). The trope often serves as a symbol of the downfall and punishment of femme fatales who sought to employ their beauty for seduction and manipulation. Nevertheless, Iona deconstructs the encoded message into a liberation of the physical body <a href="#cmnt1">[a]</a><a href="#cmnt2">[b]</a>. The trope evolves into a radical and unbridled rebellion against the prevailing beauty standards entrenched within the patriarchal system.</p>

  <p>There Is A Woman on the Pedestal is a collaborative project with the capacity to engage up to three participants (fig. 3). Within this installation, each of the three paint-filled jars is equipped with a water pump that connects to a heartbeat sensor. <a href="#ftnt1">[1]</a> As participants place their fingertips within the sensors encased by white rubber and plastic, their heart rate modulates the water pumps in the jar, creating a synchronized flow of ink through tubes. The other end of the tubes is attached to the top of columns erected at the corners of the transparent cube. These columns share the same material as the cover of the heartbeat sensor, featuring a textured surface bearing hand-kneading traces and holes at their upper ends that allow the tubes to pass through (fig.4). On the two sides of the cube oriented toward both the participants and the audience, Iona affixes a pair of four-finger molds for gripping the cube. Unlike those single-finger detectors, these two sets are not linked to any equipment. The black paint responds solely to the participants' heartbeats and gradually trickles through the layer of white minerals atop the cube, resulting in splatters on the white silk paper within the cube.</p>

  <p>In line with Donna Haraway's assertion that cyborgs exist in a space where the boundary between the literal and the figurative is in constant flux, the performance also incorporates these two types of replacements.<a href="#ftnt2">[2]</a> Iona utilizes angelite, deicing salt and shell powder to represent the mineral constituents of bones, namely, calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate. Angelite is particularly selected due to its common use in bone repair and its property of disintegrating into plaster upon contact with water, akin to the second stage of petrification where an organism's original solid material being replaced by minerals. However, the distinction arises from Iona's deliberate decision to display the bone compositionally rather than preserving its original shape. Figuratively, she holds the cube as if it were her womb, pressing its sharp edges and corners against her abdomen to signify the pain of delivery. Moreover, the finger holders and the columns are designed to resemble human skin, deliberately featuring uneven surfaces to convey suppleness, to obscure the boundary between human and machine.</p>
  <p>As mentioned above, turning into a skeleton is regarded as a punitive consequence. The fundamental premise that a woman's entire worth hinges solely upon her appearance is a distinctly patriarchal manifestation. However, the fusion of technology and biology in shaping new forms of existence diminishes the importance of external appearance as identity markers in a cyborg society. In what Harawy envisioned, the cyborg society as a collective will potentially overcome the constraints associated with conventional gender norms and the limitations of the human body. This departure from outward forms symbolizes the deconstruction of the fundamental body, epitomized by the exposed machinery in the performance. Instead of constructing a covering shell, Iona purposely reveals the structure and wiring of the devices (fig.5). The observable arrangement details the connections of the purple, red, and black wires to the motor and panel. Even the tape used to secure the wires is transparent to ensure maximum visibility. In current discourse, there is a frequent assertion of wanting to "broaden the aesthetic to recognize the beauty in all body types and skin colors," yet this is still operating within the context of valuing appearance. Iona, however, takes a more radical step. She actively discards appearance and renders the skeleton a complete emancipation, which offers everyone-irrespective of skin color or physique-an equal standing.</p><br></br>

      <p>Iona is engaging in a comparable act by subverting the conventional skeleton trope, not only through her intended message but also through her way of delivering, which diverges from the nostalgic vibe of the classical stories and TV shows. It also challenges what people take for granted: does a woman seated on a pedestal inherently represent a goddess?</p>

      <p><a href="#ftnt_ref1">[1]</a> Iona was dissatisfied with her initial choice of red, yellow, and blue paint as they evoked associations with Malevich and Mondrian. In an attempt to deepen the hues, she added some ink, which inadvertently transformed the colors into black paint.</p>

      <p><a href="#cmnt_ref1">[a]</a> It could be my problem, but I'm having trouble grasp the meaning of 'the essential body'. Maybe you were trying to say a liberation of the natural body or original body, aka原本的身体.</p>
      <p><a href="#cmnt_ref2">[b]</a> Here I want to indicate the "body" in essentialism--the entity has inherent and unchanging characteristics that define their fundamental nature. I change it to "physical body." Not sure if that makes sense? If not, we can use natural body.</p>
