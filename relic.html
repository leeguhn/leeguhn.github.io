        Blending physical and digital references, Relic functions as a spatial collage: part ruin, part monument, part imagined environment. It reinterprets everyday structures into something both immersive and unfamiliar, where scale and function feel at once disjointed and cohesive. Each scene exists at a distinct scale and plane, layering perspectives in a way that makes the object both intricate in content and compact in dimension.

        The name Relic stems from it being a souvenir for my time in New York—watching movies at the AMC, walking through the city and its galleries, and meditating in the bathtub. In future iterations, Relic can become a customizable artifact, shaped by an individual’s life and experiences. The placement and scale of different spaces could be arranged to reflect personal memories, values, and lifestyles, transforming it into a deeply personal monument.

        As a hybrid structure, Relic offers different experiences on- and offline:
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Physical Form:</b> 3D printed as a sculptural object, allowing users to engage with its spaces through touch. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Digital Simulation:</b> Iniitally appearing as a framed on a wall - until the viewer approaches, at which it turns out to be a large monument, with its scale shifting through perception and distance.
