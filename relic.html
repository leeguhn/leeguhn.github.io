        Relic brings together familiar spaces—dense cities, cinemas, bathrooms, caves—into a single sculptural form. Each scene exists at a distinct scale and plane, layering perspectives in a way that makes the object both intricate in content and compact in dimension.

        Blending physical and digital references, Relic functions as a spatial collage: part ruin, part monument, part imagined environment. It reinterprets everyday structures into something both immersive and unfamiliar, where scale and function feel at once disjointed and cohesive.    </p>

    <p>
        As a hybrid structure, Relic offers different experiences on- and offline. It can be 3D printed as a sculptural object, allowing users to engage with its spaces through touch. In a digital simulation, it first appears as a framed object on a wall—until the viewer approaches, revealing it as a vast monument, its scale shifting through perception and distance.
