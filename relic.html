        <p><b>Rameen Saad</b> (she/her) is a MAPH graduate from the University of Chicago with a focus on Postcolonial and South Asian literature. Her research aims to investigate the intersection of nostalgia and displacement in the context of homeland. Her special focus is ultimately to give voice to South Asian women, centering them on the world’s stage. She currently works at an Afghani refugee center, hoping to now make a difference firsthand.</p>
        
        <p><b>Shiyu Zhang</b> is a MAPH-TLO student focusing on linguistics at the University of Chicago. She is interested in the semantics-pragmatics interface, specifically in the ambiguity of meaning in discourse and the pragmatic effect of certain linguistic items. She has been working with sentence-final particles in Chinese (primarily Mandarin) since her undergraduate studies. She is currently working for Prof. Ming Xiang on Mandarin sentence-final particles in longer discourses, where context is a more prominent factor at play.</p>
        
        <p><b>Qianyu Fu</b> (b. 2000) is a multidisciplinary artist who started practicing in China and moved to Chicago for further study. She did her BFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and is currently an MFA candidate at the University of Chicago. She uses photography, sculpture, installation, and film to explore themes about home, identity, and the perception of truth in social-political content. Qianyu’s present work seeks to grasp how living in different cultural contexts affects her awareness of truth by joining objects with replicas to question the absurdity of contemporary human existence.</p>

        <p>Recognition is familiarity, a pathway from ignorance to knowledge. During our discussion, especially in its initial stages, Qianyu described how visiting her hometown, Wenzhou, and its reliance on the sea informed her childhood. Her visits to her grandparent’s home are always marked by the profundity of recollection but also a distance – the language, the people, the cultural artifacts are strangely hers yet not. As someone who herself has been through extraordinary change, shifting continents and leaving everything behind to start life anew in America, I found her words resonate deeply with the conundrum most international students face – who are you when you do not seem to belong anywhere? This disconnect and lack of true belonging is a key component in her earlier work. </p>

        <p>Qianyu uses concrete taken from her childhood home that has now been demolished, as well as chairs from the site, to create sculptures. This intends not only to show the permanence of destruction, but begin her artistic journey into the nature of change and the alienation that comes from it. In our conversation, Qianyu insists that she does not want to categorize her work as anything, that the act of naming in itself causes the subject, or object, to lose its very essence and beauty. Instead, she clings to the phrase, “words fail me.” This is not an admission of defeat. Instead, it is the acknowledgment that profound feelings do not need to have words for them. </p>
        
        
        <p>With her short film, Qianyu uses bright colors and magical elements to display a childish, beautiful serenity with subjects that are easily recognisable, but reshaped and anamorphized. Fish talks, technology rattles and the world comes to life. The villagers are strange, half-man half-fish creatures. The distinctly magical realist elements intend to subvert the absurdity of fantasy and show how reality is not more real than this world. Sometimes fairy tales, as Qianyu points out, can be used for an authentic exposure of the real world. </p>

        <p>Qianyu positions herself as a fish out of water – a mermaid – speaking in a made up dialect to add on to the confusion resplendent within the film. Within our discussion, she reveals that this is due to her inability to speak her local dialect, a thing of the past now kept alive through her grandmother. Each part of the film intends to display the culture shock of realizing a part of you has been left behind in history. Its heavy emphasis on language displays how the loss of it means losing a part of your identity. The role language plays in your life is incredibly important. It is a mode of expression, lost without the necessary semantics one needs to convey emotion. Though Mandarin stays deeply true to her, the loss of the Wenzhou dialect will not allow her to truly stay in touch with her past. There is a loss of permanence, of context. When the mermaid speaks, it is gibberish. Her meaning is lost. </p>
        
        
        
        <p>The art of Qianyu Fu is therefore an art of recalling a demolished past. It is jarring in its familiarity, and haunting in its authenticity. As Shiyu and I dissected her work with her, we ultimately confronted our own relationships with home and language, funnily enough finding connection within our disconnection. Feelings of strangeness seemed to dissolve in our shared realities, and our questions melded into one: what is home? Though we found no solid answer, it exists within the margins, a feeling we cannot exactly put a finger on but is very much alive and present. </p>

        <p>Alienation and existential contemplation permeate Qianyu’s artistic expressions. The artist constantly experiences spatial alienation as she is physically away from home and adapting to new environments. This theme is manifested poignantly in <em>The Way Back Home The Tale of a Mermaid</em>, where audio attempts to convey a narrative in a fictionalised speech reminiscent of Qianyu’s hometown dialect, Wenzhou dialect. But clearly and unfortunately, what the mermaid says cannot be understood, underscoring her marginalisation and estrangement from the familiar and comforting. The recipient and the audience fail to interpret as if the mermaid’s speech had been encrypted. </p>
        
        <p>In our dialogue, Qianyu, Rameen, and I collectively explored our shared experiences of alienation stemming from residing in communities and places distant from our origins. This sentiment persists even upon us returning home, as we find ourselves no longer locals in the purest sense but rather outliers - strangers in our places of origin and foreigners in where we are heading.</p>

        <p>The sense of alienation deepens as we delve into discussions about the temporal and emotional distances arising from physical separation. Qianyu’s transformation of an undermaintained ordinary exhibition space, rendering it entirely white, symbolises the erasure of its previous existence. What used to be there in the room seems disappeared over the blinding whiteness. The interior of the room crossed over time with the new paint and is, now, in the present. The blinding whiteness embodies emptiness, echoing the absence born of the insecurity bred by geographical distances. Qianyu questions the feasibility of the simultaneous coexistence of the present and the past. Through intentionally reproducing residue marks on the walls, she aims to recreate the previous statue of use. The LED light panels further accentuate the intricate layers of existence. Does the past linger in the present, or is it a mere fabrication? In our three-dimensional reality, temporal distances defy manipulation, in that we cannot trick the distance among the past, present, and future, compelling us to question the authenticity of our perceptions. The truth.</p>
        
        <p>Qianyu’s work is a quest for truth and an exploration of her perceived distance from the reality. Manipulating perspectives, she challenges the conventional notion of truth. According to the ideology many of us grew up with, the truth is ultimate. It is a constant. It should be an immutable reference point. But in works like the white exhibition space and the disoriented rocking chair, Qianyu places the ‘immutable reference point’ under scrutiny. Light, a pivotal element in her work, enables us to gain visual capacity, yet the constant interplay of noises like temperature, printer model, and the object presence distorts colour perception. The colour in the photo can only be exponentially close to that of the chair. According to Qianyu, ‘We can never get the truth, but any status it is in is authentic to its moment and being.’</p>

        <p>In an era of rapid information dissemination and easy access, Qianyu contends that this immediacy fosters a lack of verification and significance. The abundance of floating information contributes to a sense of absence, creating a void.The absence inherent in the influx of floating information becomes a void. Qianyu engages with her art to grapple with this overwhelming absence, where the act of presenting known information becomes a simultaneous act of relinquishing it, acknowledging the inherent limitations and susceptibility to scrutiny in what she already knows.</p>
        
        <p>Qianyu’s artistic creations manipulate perspectives and the conditions under which they are perceived. Upon reflection, her work challenges our relationship with the reality and prompts profound questions about existence, particularly after experiencing the absurdity of spatial and temporal distance that evoke a haunting emptiness.</p><br></br>
