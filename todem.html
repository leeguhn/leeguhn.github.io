        TODEM (Tapestry of Decadent Meritocracy) is a colossal AI-assisted GIF created by Latent Culture, an AI production venture based within Jason Salavon Studio at the University of Chicago.     
        Harnessing generative AI to produce content on an industrial scale, it explores themes of polarity, amorality, and meritocracy while probing emerging possibilities for AI and blockchain in art.

    <p>
        The GIF decomposes to 1000 unique tiles. The tiles contain numerous subtiles whose content is derived via the top 5226 English-language Wikipedia pages (by pageview). Utilizing an in-house rendering system, interface, and minting platform, alongside AI text & image synthesis, TODEM may be the largest animation ever created at 100K x 58K pixels (~2800 HD screens or 5800 megapixels) and 100 frames.

        I was brought onto the project to bridge design and development, ensuring TODEM’s immense scale and complexity were both navigable and engaging for users. As the sole team member fluent in both UI/UX design and coding, I worked closely with frontend and backend developers to integrate visual and functional elements seamlessly. My contributions included:

        Ensuring cross-platform compatibility, conducting rigorous testing for both desktop and mobile
    </center></p>

        By balancing artistic intent with technical execution, I helped refine TODEM’s accessibility, making its massive scale and intricate details more comprehensible to a broad audience and contribute to the project grossing over $100,000 in sales.
